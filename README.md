<h1> Terraform MongoDB Atlas DevOps Project </h1>

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

This Terraform project focuses on deploying a mongodb atlas cluster to mongodb atlas where it will contain a database. The project utlises two modules - one module is centred around the cluster itself, and the second module is setting up the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) which will be used for a peering connection with the mongodb atlas cluster which will, in turn, further improve the security of the cluster via having more ways to access the cluster, and not just through connecting to the cluster using the command line interface or CLI. Datadog will be implemented to monitor the health and performance of the cluster to ensure that it is functioning as expected with regards to the number instances used and the compute size for some of the instances depending on the level of scalability that this cluster adopts. It is important to note that this project also adheres to the best secuirty practices with regards to using pre-commits to ensure that my terraform code or infrastructure does not have an security risks, and that it follows the best practice when it comes to securtiy. Terratests were utilised as a means to ensure module funactionality.

Now that I provided a brief overview for the project, I will delve into the various parts of the project, and discuss these parts in great depth as a way to give you, the reader, a deeper understanding of how this project is built, and how you can create this project for yourself as well.

<h2> Cluster Module </h2>
The cluster module comprises a number of different directories:
